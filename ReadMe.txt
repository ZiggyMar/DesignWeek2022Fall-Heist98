Hey! Here is My project from Sheridan College Design Week 2022 Fall.

Sheridan College hosts two “design weeks” per year, where students participate in school-run game jams. These events offer an excellent opportunity for game design students to showcase their skills and creativity while collaborating with their peers to create exceptional games.

During these game jams, students are given a specific theme that they must follow to create a game within a week. In Design Week November 2022, the theme given was "AltCTRL," and we are proud to have delivered HEIST 98’.

The game takes players back in time to the 1990s, where you are planning to execute a daring heist. As players progress through the game, they must use various non-traditional controls to completely steal as many valuables as possible and overcome obstacles (doors) While the security player has to use the microphone provided to ‘OPEN’ & ‘CLOSE’ doors using voice commands.

Our team's passion for game design and creativity shines through in HEIST 98’. The game’s unconventional game mechanics, combined with our simple but “advanced” controls, it is sure to create an unforgettable gaming experience. We are excited to have had the opportunity to showcase our skills and are happy to annouce that we got the opportunity to share our game with the world at GDC 2023!




There are TWO Roles.

Security Gaurd:

Use Microphone by saying "Open" or "Close" to open or close the current door you're looking at

Using the numbers "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6..." to switch cameras.


Theif:

Use the arrow keys to move around and steal valuable pieces

Tap UP arrow to move and HOLD left and right to look around.



This project was a fun project to make, and I'm glad it went this far.
